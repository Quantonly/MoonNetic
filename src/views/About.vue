With the knowledge we acquired during our first two years of our course, we have succeeded in setting up a hosting platform.</p>
              <p class="darkmode-animation dark:text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-4 text-blueGray-400">Our name originated from our pursuit of reliability of our platform. We find it important that you website will be online as much as possible. We got our name from NASA’s moon landing, as it only used 8kb of RAM to get there. That’s how we got to the idea that our hosting service should be efficient and reliable. Our slogan “Hosting till the moon and back” also came from this.</p>
